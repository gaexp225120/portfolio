            I have approximately 2 and a half years of Full-stack development
            experience and half a year of AI modeling experience. I started
            taking on cases with my classmates during my senior year of college.

            I&apos;m outgoing and friendly, getting along and collaborating well
            with everyone. I love learning new technologies and exploring new
            things, and I am diligently working to enhance my skills and become
            a more proficient engineer.

            When I&apos;m not on the computer, I usually work out at gym, go
            indoor rock climbing, play some video games, or hang out with my
            friends or family
